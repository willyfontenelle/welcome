## Willy Fontenelle
I've been working with digital design for over 10 years in app, platform and website projects as a UI/UX designer and proposing solutions that not only achieve business goals, but also improve user life and make development more efficient.

My work has always been very close to the technology area, developing interfaces and systems, but never leaving aside a full understanding of the problem, which is why I was also able to get involved with research and discovery processes.

I'm currently studying front end web programming and ReactJS, in order to extend my contribution to the team and the project and ensure more autonomy in the technical documentation of a design system.
